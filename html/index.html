    ===This HTML is produced by a !/client-side/! DSL===
    * This presentation proposes a major technology swap-out.
    * This web page is rendered by an autonomous markdown/markup language.
    * Currently, it uses javascript regex and Object key:value stores.
    * The goal is to replace those with a DSL &ftree; lookup algorithm.
    * This will be smaller, faster, more useful, and more powerful.
    * The current order of calculation is O(N&sup2;logN) (N regex.replaces).
    * It will be O(N) when &ftree; is fully implemented and integrated.
    ___
    ===Heilmeier Catechism===
    * 1 What are you trying to do? Articulate your objectives using absolutely no jargon.
    * 2 How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
    * 3 What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
    * 4 Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
    * 5 What are the risks?
    * 6 How much will it cost?
    * 7 How long will it take?
    * 8 What are the mid-term and final “exams” to check for success?
    ___
    ===Heilmeier Answers===
    * 1 Accelerate !=lookup, canonicalization, translation, recognition=!
    * 2 Separate !=key:value=! association and !=fuzzy logic=!.
    * 3 !=&ftree;=! (redundant-path table-driven lexing) is smaller/faster.
    * 4 Combining lexing with lookup and fuzzy logic saves time and storage.
    * 5 Replacing separate algorithms with one big one introduces uncertainty.
    * 6 As it is Open Source, all costs are development and testing.
    * 7 Proof-of-concept is tested.  Full implementation would take months.
    * 8 !=&ftree;=! can be used in limited scopes during its trial phase.

  <section id="Overview">
    ___
    =&ftree; is a Useful Algorithm=
    * &ftree; is not commonplace or available in libraries I've reviewed.
    * It is simple in structure and easy to splice/prune test, and debug.
    * O(N) is the lookup order and size is limited only by RAM (for now).
    * O(NlogN) is needed for traditional dictionaries (hash buckets).
    ___
    ===Canonicalization===
    * Happiness can be mistyped in a variety of recognizable ways.
    * Happiness: Hppiness, Happyness, Happness, Happines, H@pp1ne$$, Js[[omrdd
    * (4 Levenshtein1s, hacker, and a keyboard displacement)
    * Room for more fuzziness: Soundex, NYSSIS, Metaphone, acronym...
    ___
    ===Translation===
    * Happiness can be translated into many languages.
    * Happiness: Bonheur, Glück, خوشی, ความสุข, Lumturi, 幸福, Счастье
    * (English to French, German, Urdu, Thai, Albanian, Chinese, Russian)
    * No limit on language translation within Unicode standard.
    ___
    ===Recognition===
    * Happiness can be identified in many languages.
    * Bonheur, Glück, خوشی, ความสุข, Lumturi, 幸福, Счастье: Happiness
    * (French, German, Urdu, Thai, Albanian, Chinese, Russian to English)
    * Quick word language switch.
    ___
    =All Possible=
    * A prototype is already functional in Python.
    * It is being re-implemented in C (CFFI interface) for optimization.
    * Javascript implementation will be easy too.
    * A shareable tree is updateable with journaling to avoid race conditions.
    * Much redundancy improves memory packing density for many-to-many lookup.
    ____
  </section>

  <section id="Dictionaries">
    ___
    * This calculation/retrieval is O(NlongN).
    * Dictionaries (key:value stores) enable 1:1 associations.
    * You give the dictionary a key, it returns a value.
    ___
    * The most common use is string word:word or segment:segment.
    * An indexable store is used.
    * The key is "hashed" to produce an index.
    * The key stored at the indexed location is compared.
    * If the comparison fails, increase the index (with wrap) until found.
    * Return the value stored at the location.
    ___
    * Frequently used lookups are cached for faster access.
    ____
  </section>

  <section id="Fuzzy Trees">
    ___
    * This calculation/retrieval is O(N).
    * &ftree; enable N:N associations.
    * You give google a key, it returns many associated values.
    ___
    * The proposed algorithm is similar.
    * The most common comparable use is compiler internal lexing.
    * Bits of the key are used to index tables directly (no hash).
    * The value is a list of associations and their "distance" from exact.
    * If the comparison fails, there is no match.
    * The client decides amongst the values.
    ___
    * No caching is necessary since it's faster than hashing.
    * <a href="?page=&vm;">&vm;</a> is used for improved localized performance

  <section id="Logic">
    ___
    ...Fuzzy trees use the power of LR1 table-driven lexers
    to use each character of a key exactly once during lookup
    and deliver an array of potential matches to the caller.
    ___
    ...If requested, the table is filled with alternate keys
    to enable redundant pathways from similar or grouped keys
    to arrays of potential matches.
    For a given key, one can generate multiple variations
    such as Levenshtein, Soundex, NYSSIS, Metaphone, FatFinger,
    and new ones designed for custom needs.
    ___
    ...In the "Home" menu item on this page, there are examples
    of how variations may appear.
    One of note "Js[[omrdd" is how typing happiness appears
    if both hands are displaced over the keyboard by one key to the right.
    ___
    ...The tables are buiilt as banks of indices which are dereferenced
    by shift/masking the Unicode codepoint 21 bits into 7 groups of 3 bits.
    It is this shift/masking which makes the lookup O(N).
    This makes the table robust for re-use of banks for multiple keys.
    It is this redundancy which makes the Fuzzy Tree memory efficient.
    ___
    ...When this is done using C, C++, ASM, or javascript JIT/V8
    the instruction stream is very short and much faster than
    hashing/lookups in dictionaries.
    ____
  </section>

  <section id="Unicode">
    ___
    ...Here is an example of how a
    21 bit codepoint string is converted to indices
    in the form of an identity mapping A:A, B:B, C:C, L:L, 山:山.
    * "A山"
    * [0x000041 0x005C71]
    * [[000 000 000 000 001 000 001], [000 000 101 110 001 110 001]]
    ___
    ...The Unicode codepoint 000041 ('A') is broken, as can be seen into
    7 groups of 3 bits each forming a pathway of
    indexing through a basic block.
    A basic block starts with 8 banks of 8 values including
    the final bank of index/pointers into next basic blocks.
    Note in the second example below how the letters 'A', 'B', and 'C'
    all carve the same pathway through the basic block until the last one.
    A basic block starts with 8 banks, but may grow as necessary
    to handle as many codepoints occupy this position.
    ___
    ...A basic block is produced for each letter position in a segment.
    This is the atomic unit of a fuzzy tree.
    It is a table for converting multiple Unicode codepoints
    into indices or pointers to !=next=! basic blocks.
    1st codepoints are supported with sufficient redundancy
    to remain space efficient while identifying all possible
    2nd codepoints in as many basic blocks as necessary
    to resolve to their intended targets.
    ^^^
    ...Here is how the tables appear in memory when codepoints are added.
    Intentionally displayed using "%04x" % (codepoint) rather than "%06x".

  <section id="Virtual Memory">
    ___
    ...The goal is to build a software virtual memory
    using demand-paging into local page-frames as needed.
    Instead of flushing dirty pages back to the central store,
    modifications are stored in a local cache which is flushed
    to a journal at the central store which updates
    the global store which then also publishes
    the dirtiness of pages to all clients.
    ___
    ...Dirty pages on the client are invalidated
    causing a page fault on next access
    and replacement from the global store.
    ___
    ...This enables pages updated by any client
    to be registered in the global store
    and to be published and pushed.
    ___
    ...As long as the local page-frames contain
    the actively used pages for the attached clients
    and no pages are made dirty from the global store,
    no page faults are generated and
    this mode of operation is equivalent or superior to
    a caching system for recently or frequently used
    virtual memory pages.
    ___
    ...In fact, the virtual memory can be multi-layered
    with the client browser having a per-client set of pages
    the edge server having a superset serving multiple clients
    and a regional (language-centric) server serving
    multiple edge servers and finally,
    the global store which may be implemented as
    a distributed key:value store (such as Amplidata or Cleversafe).
