This library offers a set of functions designed to be very high performance while being as high quality as reasonable.

The principle approach uses two methods considered unusual for modern development.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Multiple dereferencing table-\/driven paths
\item Computed G\+O\+T\+O to eliminate if/for/while
\end{DoxyItemize}

The code is designed to be very short and tight. It makes use of the gnu compiler stack where computed G\+O\+T\+O has been a standard extension for many years, where other compilers have not.

The general approach to table-\/driven paths is explained in the main R\+E\+A\+D\+M\+E.\+md which is in the parent directory to this.

This directory will be the primary area for development of a shared Python library because C\+F\+F\+I is less friendly to C++ than it is to C function entrypoints.

\subsection*{T\+O\+D\+O}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Test U\+T\+F8 $<$-\/$>$ char32 transforms in test\+\_\+\+Unicode.\+c
\item Improve coverage
\item Improve unit testing
\item Eliminate extra includes
\item Review doxygen comments
\item Clarify typedefs
